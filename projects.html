            <p>The project aims to analyze road closure data provided by the Kentucky Transportation Cabinet (KYTC). 
                The primary objective is to identify trends in road closures to better understand network resiliency during periods of extreme weather events.</p>

            <p>I've always been interested in the stock market. 
                This project is a simple hobby project that I've created as a method of backtesting my investment strategies and continuing with my python development.</p>

            <p>Using various ML models, I've developed a small dashboard that demonstrates a buy-on-dip investment strategy as well as provides short term and long term forecasting using different models. 
                I've used this project to learn more about developing a python based webpage using Dash and Plotly in addition to using machine learning models from Prophet and scikit-learn.</p>
